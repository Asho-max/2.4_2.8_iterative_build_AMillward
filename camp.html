							<h2 class="main-content-h2"><b>Day 1 Info and Itinerary</b></h2>
							<p class="main-content-p">
								Students will congregate with their form class. They will need to have their day pack/ 
								backpack with lunch, water bottle, sun hat, a warm jumper/thermal and rain jacket. 
								In addition they will have one overnight bag, with the gear listed below, and a tent 
								if you are providing one. The day pack must be separate from the overnight bag. 
								Please wear appropriate sports clothing with lace up sports shoes with good grip. 
								No denim please. Bring your own medication if required.
								<br/><br/>
								Once the roll has been taken we will catch a private bus to Wainui.
								<br/><br/>
								Students will be taken straight to camp Wainui where they will first construct a tent 
								with their friends and put their overnight bag inside. We have a large camping area at 
								the back of the camp as well as the use of the hall and kitchen and toilets in the huts.
								<br/><br/>
								There are a few showers available but we would strongly discourage the use of 
								the showers where possible as it takes a while for 260 people to shower and we 
								are only away for one night.
								<br/><br/>
								From here Students will rotate through three activities at the camp, stopping for 
								lunch between activities. The activities here are:
								*Raft building, which also includes how to fit lifejackets correctly and how to use throw ropes</br>
								*Emergency bivvy making</br>
								*Search and rescue skills and team challenges

							<h2 class="main-content-h2"><b>Reminders</b></h2>
							<p class="main-content-p">
								There is very limited cell phone coverage at camp. If you need to contact your child in an emergency and you 
								cannot reach them via their mobile phone, please contact the school during school hours or Camp Wainui after 
								hours on (04) 564 5305. There are not an abundance of powerpoints for students to charge their phones whilst 
								away. I would advise them to either have a power bank or even better, turn their phone to aeroplane mode 
								whilst at camp to preserve battery and then turn it back on when they arrive back at school if they need 
								to contact you for a lift home etc. They should not be on their devices whilst away.
								<br/><br/>
								In the permission slip caregivers agreed that they would discuss with their child the rules of camp. These 
								include no alcohol, vaping, smoking, drugs and following the rules at all times. If students are found to 
								break these rules then you will be called to come and pick them up and there may be further consequences at 
								school. Once it is 'lights out' in the evening all students must stay in their own tents.
								<br/><br/>
								If you have not yet paid, please do so immediately. If payment is a problem please let me know. The total cost 
								for the four days is $80. If you have a personalised programme due to injuries etc, please contact the school 
								office and they will advise you on how much you need to pay. If you wish to pay via internet banking, please 
								use the following: <b>Details are Tawa College, 123192-0011938-00. Please include 'Calitz, Joshua' and 'EOTC' 
								in the reference box.</b>
								<br/><br/>
								A reminder students need to bring their own packed lunches for both days. Please ensure your son or daughter 
								has enough food to sustain them on the 10km walk and for the activities at camp. Water bottles can be refilled 
								from the camp taps.

								In your day pack you should have: lunch, water bottle, sun hat, sunscreen, a warm jumper/thermal and

								<br/><br/>

								Pyjamas, torch, sleeping bag, a full change of warm clothes, warm hat, small towel, togs if you wish 
								to go in the lagoon for raft building. Toothbrush and toothpaste. Your packed lunch for the second day, 
								roll mat or inflatable mattress (highly recommended but you will cope without one). Any medication / 
								sanitary items you may require. Please name your bag clearly with your name and form class.
								<br/><br/>

								Tent/sleeping bags - if your family can provide a tent and/or spare sleeping bags, please label it 
								clearly with your name and form class. Parents - I would advise you to check how many tent pegs etc 
								there are so that your son or daughter gets them all back in.
								<br/></br/>
								I will be on the camps for the four days with limited reception and access to emails. 
								If there are any problems during that time, please contact the school office.

								We will wake nice and early and have a breakfast of cereals, toast and spreads.
								<br/></br/>
								Tents will be packed down and overnight bags packed. These will be left in a pile ready for the 
								buses to pick them up in the afternoon.
								<br/></br/>
								Students will take their day pack with their second lunch and a water bottle, rain jacket and warm 
								top/hat and board the bus to go 7kms down the road to the Catchpool carpark in the Remutaka Valley Park. 
								From here he will walk the Orongorongo track in and out of the valley (5.2km each way). Please note, 
								there is a track detour right at the end of the track due to a potential slip - we will be taking the 
								detour that DOC has provided. On the way Students will learn some map reading skills and about local 
								flora and fauna.
								<br/></br/>
								Once in the valley, students will have lunch and also:<br/>
								*Learn how to build their own hobo stoves for cooking in the bush.<br/>
								*If the river is at its usual height of up to calf depth and not fast flowing, we will learn about river crossings. If there has been more rainfall than usual and the river is deeper or more fast flowing, this will be cancelled.
								<br/></br/>
								Then we will head back along the track to the car park where a private bus will pick us up and transport us back to school for around 3.30pm.
