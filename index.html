								As part of the Year 10 programme, students will be participating in 
								<b>four</b> days of Education Outside the Classroom (EOTC).

								<br/><br/>
								The four days of activities in which your son/daughter will participate 
								are as follows: Community Service, Rangituhi Walk, Adrenaline Forest/

								Students will be required to wear appropriate mufti clothing on all 
								days. This involves good walking/sports shoes, rain coat, sun block, 
								and suitably warm clothing.
								</br><br/>
								Students will not be allowed to participate in these trips if they do not 
								have the correct gear. If you have any difficulty supplying these required 
								items please indicate on the return form and we will endeavour to assist 
								where possible. On all trips students will be expected to abide by the 
								school rules. This includes absolutely no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol. 
								Students will be expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is 
								respectful to both the supervising teachers and other students. Anyone 
								who does not comply with these requirements will be sent back to 
								school and/or home at the expense of their parents/caregivers.

								These trips will run from Tuesday 3 December to Friday 6 December. 
								All of these trips will depart from Tawa College at 8:35am and will 
								return by 3:20pm. The total cost of the trips is $75.00 per student. 
								This includes transport and the cost of all activities. Due to the 
								nature of the activities and the fixed costs involve, there will be 
								no refunds given. Students are expected to bring a packed lunch on 
								all of these days as they will not have any opportunities to purchase lunch.

								It is essential that all students on the trip play their part in risk 
								management. Their personal safety is very much their responsibility 
								and they must always act in a manner that does not endanger either 
								themselves or others. It is important that they follow the instructions 
								of staff at all times.
								<br/><br/>
								All these activities are compulsory but have been designed to be both 
								education and fun. Students will be supervised at all times by Tawa 
								College staff. If you have not already returned the permission forms 
								given out earlier this term then please collect another copy of the 
								forms from the school office, and hand them in to the student office 
								along with $75.00 before Friday 25 October. If you have already 
								returned the permission forms then you only need to pay the $75.00 
								before Friday 25 October.
